## Research of the Festival Industry in Spain.</br>
Research question: [is it possible to fest in Spain seamlessly all year round?](https://blog.iaac.net/party-to-live-or-live-to-party/)</br>
tools: Python 3.8, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, GoogleDeepTranslator, BeautifulSoup, Grasshopper (Rhinoceros 3d 7), QGIS 3.28.2, Capcut.</br>
# What I learned: 
- Data mining, data cleaning, data preparation, data manipulation with Python
- Data vizualisation with QGIS and Grasshopper using dynamic maps
- Calendar-making from csv in Grasshopper, data distribution by dates
## Key takeaways
- by 2022 there is around 1000 festivals in Spain performed yearly
- festivals in Spain have categories that correlate with state and local subventions: Interes Internacional, Interes National, Interes Local
- main concentration of festivals is allocated in Catalan Countries: Catalonia, Valencia, Balearic Islands
